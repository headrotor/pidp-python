# pidp-python
Python code for Oscar Vermeulen's PiDP PDP-8 replica.

NB: All code in this repo is written by a hobbyist and is barely fit to be viewed, let alone used.

PiDP_CP_NT.py contains a Python 3 control panel class for lighting the LEDs and reading the state of the switches on the PiDP.
pidpnt-demo.py is a demo program to show how the control panel class can be used.
